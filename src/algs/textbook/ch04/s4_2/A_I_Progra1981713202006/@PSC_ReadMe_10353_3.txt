Title: A.I Program - Chatterbot Eliza v2.0 (c++ eliza)
Description: I HAVE POSTED THIS CODE TO SOME OTHER WEBSITES (CODEPROJECT.COM AND OTHERS) AND I HAVE RECEIVE SOME VERY GOOD FEEDBACKS ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT THIS CHATBOT IS FAIRLY SMART, SO DONT FORGET TO VOTE FOR ME!
This version of the program is smarter than ever, more new features have been 
added since the last submission and also now the conversation log between
the users and the chatbot are automaticaly saved into the file: log.txt
And finaly the "script file" (script.txt) wich acts as a knowledge base 
for the chatbot has been totaly rewritten and it is definitly better 
than in the previous versions of the program.
These program is an Eliza like chatterbot,bots like Eliza are the results
of researchs in Artificial Intelligence (more specificly: in NLP and NLU)
NLP: Natural Language Processing, NLU: Natural Language Understanding
The first chatterbot was published in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum a professor of MIT.
(http://i5.nyu.edu/~mm64/x52.9265/january1966.html)
And also,most of the chatterbots that have been written this days are largely based
on the original chatterbot Eliza that was written by Joseph Weizenbaum which means
that they use some appropriate keywords to select the responses to generate
when they get new inputs from the users. More generaly,the technique that are 
in use in a "chatterbot database" or "script file" to represent the chatterbot
knowledge is known as "Case Base Reasoning" or CBR. A very good example of an Eliza
like chatterbot would be "Alice",these program has won the Loebner prize for most
human chatterbot three times (www.alicebot.org). The goal of NLP and NLU is to create
programs that are capable of understanding natural languages and also capable
of processing it to get input from the user by "voice recognition" or to produce
output by "text to speech". During the last decades there has been a lot of progress
in the domains of "Voice Recognition" and "Text to Speech",however the goal of NLU
that is to make software that are capable of showing a good level of understanding
of "natural languages" in general seems quiet far to many A.I experts. The general
view about this subject is that it would take at list many decades before any computer 
can begin to really understand "natural language" just as the humans do.

There are many interesting features in the current program,these chatterbot
is capable of avoiding repetitions when selecting new responses,it can also
follow the context of a conversation with a user. When the programs detect
new keywords that are not part of the "script file", it saves it on the file
"unknown.txt" and finaly it simulates a "human typist" when displaying responses
on the screen. Actualy,there are many more features in the program,you will be
capable of finding them by reading the "source code".
The implementation of the program has been improved, the repetitions made by the program
are better handled, the context in a conversation is also better handled, the program can now
correct grammatical errors that can occure after conjugating verbs. Finaly, the database is
bigger than the last time, it includes some of the script that originaly was used in the first
implementation of the chatterbot Eliza by Joseph Weizenbaum.
